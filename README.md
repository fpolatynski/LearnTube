# LearnTube

Platform to divide YouTube content from spam and entertaining content.

## App purpose

App was created to enable productive use of YouTube resources and storage valuable films as a to-watch list and 
to help people fight with procrastination and wasteful time on noneducational content. App concept was based on 
current problem of YouTube being brimful of diversionary content. Program aims to distinguish completely educational films by creating external 
app hosted locally which contains only movies chosen by user. App support accounts to provide user with ability of being used by more than one user.

## How it works?

- App make way to store, watch add and delete movies hosted on YouTube. 

- You can add movie by link to YouTube film or search keyword inside an app to choose from recommendations. 

- App is hosted locally on your computer and works on any web browser.

## Project purpose
